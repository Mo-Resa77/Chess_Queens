# Chess Queens Solver

## Project Overview
The **Chess Queens Solver** is a solution to the famous N-Queens problem, implemented using Java. The backtracking algorithm is used to find all possible ways to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This algorithm is optimized to handle large board sizes efficiently while ensuring the best performance under different constraints.

## Key Features
- **Backtracking Algorithm**: A robust backtracking solution to explore all possible placements of queens on the chessboard.
- **Efficient Solution**: Optimized to handle large board sizes (N > 8) efficiently.
- **Scalability**: Designed to solve the problem for various sizes of the chessboard without performance degradation.
- **Computational Problem-Solving Focus**: Emphasis on algorithm design, performance testing, and efficient computation.
